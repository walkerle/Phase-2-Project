## User Navigation

As a user, you will be able to add a joke to your Favorite Jokes List from the collection of jokes in Jokes List.  The Cycle Jokes button will also randomize six new jokes if none of the jokes displayed are desired.

From the Favorite Jokes List, the user can remove a joke from the Favorites Jokes List as well as update an existing joke.

There is also a New Joke Form for the user to add new jokes to their Favorite Jokes List.
